== Recommendations, Observations, and Conclusions

This section discusses conclusions and recommendations . There is also a section on the issue of backwards compatability. A number of issues for future discussion and consideration were also identified. These include:

- Forwards compatibility in the CDB context
- How to let an application know what vector data encoding is/are available.
- Versioning and GPKG and CDB 1.2

=== Backwards compatibility in the CDB context

==== FlightSafety observations on backwards compatibility

Our view is that a form of Option 1 is backwards compatible with the existing specification, for the following reasons:

-	The CDB concept of a single "logical" file representing a vector file is preserved.
-	The CDB conceptual model leans toward mixing the data model and the files on disk.  This should be disentangled in a future version of CDB, but it is difficult to do in a minor revision.
-	CDB Versioning, where one file from a CDB dataset replaces/hides a file from another CDB dataset, would be difficult to fit together with a GeoPackage that contained "all" the vector files for that dataset.  A preferable solution is to evolve the conceptual model to handle this case in CDB 2.0.

=== Findings

==== Aechelon Findings

* For the three Experiment 2 options Aechelon tested, the best outcome in both time and file size came from option 1C.
* For Experiments 3 and 4, speed is slightly improved relative to Experiment 3 sub-option 1D but not sub-option 1C. On the other hand, the resulting storage size is markedly improved when compared against all options in Experiment 2, as would be expected. This is because, by design, these Experiments 3 and 4 go against the spirit of CDB data segmentation by file at the LOD level. This makes it more difficult to remove LODs, if so desired, when copying or exporting the CDB vector data. As such, the approaches used in Experiments 3 and 4 may not be as easy to incorporate and adopt as part of the CDB Standard.

==== CAE Findings

Although previous experiments with 1-to-1 Shapefile-to-GeoPackage conversion have been very positive, our experiences indicate mixed results. On one hand, we observe substantial benefit in reducing the number of files stored and loaded, and we also observe the possibility of a comparable (or faster) decode time; but on the other hand, we see potentially-problematic increases in the amount of storage space required.

The negative effects are amplified for CDBs with large numbers of small Shapefiles. The GeoPackage format (especially as outputted by GDAL) is very space-inefficient when it comes to encoding tiles with small quantities of data. (Notably, even if we moved to a 1-tile-per-table instead of a 1-tile-per-file approach, the underlying sqlite format seems to allocate a minimum of 4 KB per table regardless of how little data is in it.)

==== FlightSafety Findings

-	Shapefiles are a problematic format for several reasons: 
--	Shapefiles are a multi-file format to represent a single "logical" file.  Management of multi-file formats is always a bit harder than handing a single file.
--	The CDB specification's use of extra DBF (DBase III) files for class-level and extended-level attribution is not standard for any current GIS tool, and makes the multi-file format problem worse.
--	There are other small-level issues with shapefiles, including limited field name length, limited numbers of attributes, limited data types, and a single geometry type per shapefile.
--	In all three test CDB datasets, the number of files greatly exceed the proportion of space on disk.  The large number of small files causes problems with efficient disk space usage and slows the distribution of a CDB dataset.
-	Replacing a single shapefile with a GeoPackage (Option 1) seems to be a better solution for CDB 1.2 or a future CDB 1.x
--	Changes to CDB clients involve less work than other options.
--	On average, the performance was better with GeoPackage
--	On specific worst case tests, Line Strings and Polygons were faster with GeoPackage.  Points were mixed, but likely fast enough for this use case.
--	It would also fit within CDB's pre-existing versioning mechanism better than the other options, as it can maintain the single "file" paradigm where a vector file replaces/hides another vector file (even if the "file" is really a multi-file format).
--	The class-level attributes would be easy to import into a flattened GeoPackage.  Importing extended-level attributes as a related table makes sense as well, although redesigning the odd extended attribute encoding would be recommended.
--	The SWG is encouraged to implement a single vector encoding per CDB dataset/version, and a way to discover the vector encoding implemented from a file in the Metadata folder.
-	GeoPackage options 3 or 4 would be best suited to a future compatibility-breaking version of CDB 2.0. 
--	CDB client changes would be more extensive, but the performance gain would likely be worth the effort.
--	More detail and additional specification requirements would be necessary to describe how to version CDB datasets when that dataset no longer maintains the "traditional" directory and file format that versioning was designed for. 
--	The SQL query when loading the vectors that would be contained within a single shapefile can take twice as long as when these vectors are in a single GeoPackage, but the open cost can be amortized across many queries if the GeoPackage files remain open for a longer period of time.
-	The OGC Interoperability Experiment was a good testing ground to develop familiarity with GeoPackage and to help the SWG come to a better consensus on the use of GeoPackage.  We would recommend having more IE's as other parts of the specification are reviewed and improved.

==== Hexagon/Luciad Findings

*Standard Visualization Metrics* - Overall visualization performance was similar between all experiments for each dataset. Converting to GeoPackage has no significant impact either positive or negative on visualization once the data is loaded.

*Data Ingest* - Data ingest for visualization was highly dependent on the size and structure of the underlying GeoPackage datasets and the architecture of the data ingest code. Both load times and heap memory usage were much greater for the combined GeoPackages on large datasets. While major adjustments to the GeoPackage interactivity was beyond the scope of this IE minor modifications to reduce file I/O on the combined datasets showed potential for improvement in data loading time.

*Data Conversion* - For data conversion the best results were also obtained from Experiments 3 & 4. The caveat here is that some memory issues were encountered with the provided datasets as more layers and data were added to a single GeoPackage which introduces questions of scalability for these approaches.

=== Recommendations

This section describes key recommendations from each of the participating organizations. A short summary of the recommendations is provided is the Summary Section of this Engineering report.

==== Aechelon

To achieve the improvements in storage while also maintaining the speeds comparable with sub-option 1C and addressing the file-per-LOD issue, Aechelon recommends two additional experiments: (a) where each component selector of each LOD is in its own geopackage file---effectively a variant of sub-option 1C where the U and R references of the same component selectors are combined into one file; and (b) where each datasetâ€™s LODs are in a separate geopackage file---effectively a variant of Experiment 3 where instead of storing each LOD in a separate layer in the same geopackage file, each LOD is a separate file.

If Aechelon were to recommend only one processing alternative, among those in this experiment, for inclusion as an alternate primary vector format in a future OCG CDB revision, it would be option 1C in Experiment 2.

==== CAE Recommendations

===== Suggestion 1: Storage versus Transport Format

We have essentially been using GeoPackage as a data _transfer_ format in this experiment, when its design seems to be much better used as a data _storage_ format. The GeoPackage format encodes indexes, triggers, sequences, and metadata as well as feature data, and it also supports real-time addition, removal, and update of records. In this experiment, we make use of none of these features.

We suggest considering GeoJSON as a candidate format for the 1-to-1 Shapefile conversion case (Option 1a). We may, with GeoJSON, obtain the same reduction in file count while simultaneously obtaining better performance and storage characteristics for CDBs with large numbers of small vector files. To obtain scalable performance characteristics with GeoJSON, we will want to base implementations on RapidJSON or similar parser (rather than libjson, which is currently used by GDAL).

It is worth noting here also that GeoJSON supports other variants of the Option 1 experiment, e.g., attribute flattening (Options 1c/1d).

===== Suggestion 2: GeoPackage as an Incremental Data Store Version

In this experiement, we have explored the idea of placing GeoPackages _inside_ a CDB. We suggest that this may not be the best approach for maximizing compatibility. GeoPackage, like CDB, functions conceptually as an independent data store. We would like to raise the possibility of using GeoPackage as an incremental data store _version_, which would essentially allow a GeoPackage to replace a CDB version at its root (at least to the extent that all data inside the CDB can be converted losslessly into GeoPackage data). The idea is to be able to add a GeoPackage as an incremental version without modifying the underlying CDB, or vice versa. What we would have to do in this case is define a bidirectional equivalency between a CDB directory path and a GeoPackage/sqlite index--this would allow us clearly-defined semantics for mixing and matching GeoPackage and CDB data stores, with minimal impact on existing standards and implementations.

===== Suggestion 3: The CDB Directory Hierarchy as a Key-Value Store

We would like to raise a particular opportunity for future-proofing the standard. Conceptually, the CDB directory hierarchy functions as an index: any given directory path is essentially a key, and the value accessed by the key is a file. If we introduce a level of abstraction that allows us to discuss the CDB as a type of key-value store, then we open up a range of new possibilities in terms of physical implementation. For example, there are any number of database engines that are able to function as fast key-value stores, from lightweight mobile solutions like sqlite to highly-distributed cloud-capable NoSQL solutions like MongoDB. This would conceptually simplify the idea of a geographic database, allowing implementors more freedom to choose the storage technology that best suits them while simultaneously providing a natural path toward remote/Internet query of CDBs.

==== FlightSafety Recommendations

===== GeoPackage Recommendations

*	From our experience, GDAL's GeoPackage driver will create non-standard GeoPackage files.  The SWG needs to decide if that is allowed, or if a stricter GeoPackage implementation is required. 
**	GDAL defaults to using "fid" as the primary key in geometry tables.  GeoPackage specifies "id"
**	As the conversion scripts use GDAL to convert geometry from shapefile to GeoPackage, GDAL allows the creation of MultiPolygon and MultiLineString features in Polygon and LineString tables (respectively).  When this happens, GDAL emits a warning that it is not creating standard GeoPackage files.  We would recommend standardizing with GeoPackage, in only allowing a single geometry type within a table.
**	The conversion from shapefile logical fields to GeoPackage should be standardized.  It would be best to convert any CDB logical field (whether it was logical, string, or integer) into a GeoPackage boolean field.
**	The table name should include enough information to be unique, no matter which option is implemented.
*	The dataset/component selectors/lod/up/right values must be stored in the table.  Integers are recommended for storage for better performance.
*	If the SWG decides on using option 3 or 4 for a future version of CDB, then index search tables should be required for better performance when querying data from a specific CDB Tile-LOD.

==== Hexagon/Luciad Recommendation

Further investigation into the optimal structure of combining multiple sub-datasets (rail, hydrography, etc) and multiple levels of detail into a single GeoPackage could alleviate several encountered performance drawbacks with the CDB datasets in Experiments 3 & 4. At this point without this investigation and guidance Hexagon US Federal recommends the CDB architecture presented in Experiment 2 which provides both a reduction in the datasetâ€™s file count and minimizes the impact to existing CDB applications accessing data in the current tiled directory structure.
